"""Static noise margin (SNM) extraction from one or two half-cell VTC sweeps.

Why one sweep is enough for the *deterministic* PVT-corner claim: `bitcell_6t`'s
two storage inverters (MPL/MNL and MPR/MNR in design/netlist/bitcell_6t.spice)
are identical devices under a cross-coupled connection when no per-instance
mismatch is injected. For a cell built from two identical inverters, the
classic "butterfly curve" (the two inverters' voltage-transfer curves plotted
against each other, one mirrored across the line Vout=Vin) can be constructed
from a *single* inverter's VTC sweep: the first branch is the sweep itself,
y = f(x); the second branch is that same inverter's curve reflected across the
diagonal, i.e. the *inverse* relation x = f(y), which -- because the two
inverters are identical devices -- is exactly the transfer curve the other
half-cell would produce. This is a standard simplification for symmetric 6T
SRAM SNM extraction (see e.g. E. Seevinck et al., "Static-Noise Margin
Analysis of MOS SRAM Cells," IEEE JSSC 1987, for the general two-curve method
this specializes).

Why two sweeps are used for the Monte Carlo / yield claim (issue #26): device
mismatch (`sw_stat_mismatch=1` in the gf180mcu model file) draws an
independent per-instance threshold/mobility offset for every transistor
instantiated -- so under MC the two half-cells are no longer identical, and
self-composing one curve would silently assume away exactly the effect an
inter-inverter-mismatch SNM campaign exists to measure. `sim/lib/
run_mc_campaign.py` instead runs the same half-cell fixture *twice* per MC
trial, once per half-cell, each with its own independent `.option seed`, and
this script's `--pair` mode combines the two independently-mismatched curves
into a (possibly asymmetric) butterfly SNM -- the direct two-curve
generalization of the single-curve method below, per Seevinck et al. 1987's
original (non-symmetric) construction.

SNM is the side length of the largest axis-aligned square that fits between
the two curves within one lobe of the butterfly plot. In the single-curve
case, because the second curve is the exact mirror image of the first about
y=x, the maximum vertical gap between the sweep curve and its own inverse --
found for x in one lobe -- equals that maximum square's side length; in the
two-curve case the same holds between curve 1 and the *inverse of curve 2*.

Finding the two curves' intersections (f1(x) = f2^-1(x)) is equivalent to
finding the fixed points of f2 composed with f1: f2(f1(x)) = x. (The
single-curve case sets f2 = f1, recovering the familiar f(f(x)) = x.) This
script uses that composition directly, evaluated with forward interpolation
only (never constructing an explicit inverse-of-f table). That matters in
practice: a naive "swap the (x, y) pairs and sort" way of building f^-1 is
numerically fragile wherever f's sampled *output* changes extremely slowly
(its slope near either rail can under/overflow float resolution over a wide
span of x), which biases a sorted-table inverse and silently drops a real
crossing. Forward interpolation of the original, evenly-sampled-in-x sweep has
no such flat-tail pathology, so composing it with itself (or with a second,
independent curve) is the robust way to find the same roots.

Signed SNM (why a monostable draw reports a negative number, not an error):
a Monte Carlo yield campaign has to be able to *count* a failure. A draw
whose two mismatched half-cells no longer latch has no butterfly lobe and
therefore no square to measure -- reporting it as a measurement error would
push it into `klt yield`'s `errored` bucket, which is excluded from every
statistic, so the very draws the campaign exists to find would silently
vanish from the yield estimate (confirmed empirically during issue #26: a
deliberately-degraded negative control came back `not_detected` for exactly
this reason). Instead, a monostable draw reports `-d`, where `d` is the
bistability deficit -- how far the composed loop map misses re-crossing the
diagonal, in volts (see `bistability_deficit`). `d -> 0` at the bifurcation,
so the reported quantity is continuous through zero: strictly positive
values are the classical Seevinck SNM, zero is the bistability boundary, and
negative values measure how far past it a failing draw sits. Only a draw
with no measurable structure at all is still reported as an open result.

Input: one or two two-column whitespace-separated ASCII data files (Vin,
Vout), as written by ngspice's `wrdata` from a DC sweep, monotonically
increasing in Vin. Output: prints `RESULT: <label> = <value>` (volts) to
stdout, and exits 1 with a diagnostic on stderr if the curve(s) are
degenerate beyond even that signed continuation -- a reportable open result,
never silently coerced to a passing number.

Usage:
    snm_extract.py <data-file> <label>
        Single-curve / self-composed mode (unchanged since this script's
        original version) -- used by sim/lib/run_corner_sweep.sh for the
        deterministic 9-corner PVT claim.

    snm_extract.py --pair <data-file-1> <data-file-2> <label>
        Two-curve mode -- used by sim/lib/run_mc_campaign.py for the
        mismatch-driven Monte Carlo claim (issue #26). <data-file-1> and
        <data-file-2> are independent half-cell sweeps (same fixture, same
        corner, independent `.option seed`/mismatch draw per file).
