"""Unit tests for sim/lib/snm_extract.py's butterfly-curve SNM extraction.

These are pure-Python tests over *analytic* voltage-transfer curves -- no
ngspice, no PDK, so they run anywhere `npm run test` runs (CI included),
unlike the testbenches themselves. What they pin down is the extraction
*mathematics*, which is where this repo's SNM numbers actually come from:

  * the self-composed (symmetric, one-sweep) method used for the
    deterministic 9-corner claim,
  * the two-curve `--pair` method used for the Monte Carlo mismatch claim
    (issue #26), including that inter-inverter asymmetry *reduces* the
    reported margin -- the entire reason the MC campaign runs the fixture
    twice per trial instead of self-composing one draw,
  * the signed continuation past zero: a monostable draw must come back as a
    negative number so a yield campaign can count it as a failure, rather
    than as an error that every statistic silently drops.

Run: python3 sim/lib/test_snm_extract.py   (or via `npm run test`)
